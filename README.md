# Rails Playground that runs into (Gitpod)[http://www.gitpod.io/]

# Just Open it in Gitpod :point_down:

# README
This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* System dependencies `bundle install`

* Database creation `rails db:create` 

* Database initialization `rails db:migrate`

* Run the app in a local server: `rails server`

# Happy Coding! :rainbow: :octocat:
